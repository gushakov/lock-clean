/**
 * Driven (output) port for explicit transaction demarcation. A use case calls it to run its
 * persistence writes inside a narrow transaction and to defer presentation until the transaction
 * actually commits — instead of wrapping the whole interaction in a blanket {@code @Transactional}.
 *
 * <p>The shape is deliberately lean:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Validation and reads happen outside</b> {@code doInTransaction}; only persistence writes
 *       need the consistency boundary inside it.</li>
 *   <li><b>Presentation happens after commit</b> via {@link #doAfterCommit(Runnable)}, so the actor
 *       is never told an operation succeeded while the transaction might still roll back.</li>
 *   <li><b>Failure is expressed by throwing</b> — an unchecked error thrown inside the action rolls
 *       the transaction back and propagates to the use case's single outermost checkpoint. There is
 *       deliberately no {@code rollback()} method and no after-rollback hook.</li>
 *   <li><b>The machinery has its own failure currency</b> — a fault in <em>demarcation</em> (begin,
 *       commit, or unexpected rollback), as opposed to a fault in the action, surfaces as a
 *       {@link TransactionOperationsError}. The adapter translates the underlying framework exception
 *       so the use case never catches a raw transaction exception.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Actions are plain {@link Runnable} / {@link Supplier}: persistence ports raise <em>unchecked</em>
 * errors (see {@code PersistenceOperationError}), so no checked-exception plumbing is needed and a
 * thrown error triggers Spring's default rollback-on-runtime.
